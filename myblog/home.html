    <p>Doc Clark says he wants me full time in the park. Doesn’t make much sense to me, since Port Angeles is practically an hour hike north and I don’t mind walking. And Doc before you email me saying I shouldn’t be airing my grievances on the web, we both know you’ll be the only one reading this anyway. Not that I mind, it’s nice to feel like you’re adding something for people to look at when they’re home. Even if it’s the equivalent of screaming into a pillow or making snow melt with your breath.</p>

    I suppose you want this to be more formal huh Doc?
    Alright.

    MISSION STATEMENT: To produce an encyclopedia of the ecology, taxonomy, and changes found in Olympic National Park. This web page will be periodically updated and edited by one Muir Davids(hey that’s me!). It’ll also serve the parallel purpose of proving to Doc Clark that I’m actually working and not flicking my boogers into the Elwha.

    You know I’m just pushing you around Doc, don’t worry I’ll leave my public taunting to you at a minimum.
